Oct 26, codes to test for monday

1) Test pins layout for 2 stepper motor + 1 solenoid
This code is modified based on: 
https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-controls-28byj-48-stepper-motor-using-uln2003-driver
When finished testing, we'll stay with the pin layout and setup settings for all the actuators. 
	
2) Test moving commands for 1 stepper motor: 
This code is modified based on:
When finished testing, we'll STAY with the same speed setting, and "case" based command structure for the future codes
https://curiousscientist.tech/blog/arduino-accelstepper-tb6600-stepper-motor
    "R" - Change speed, eg. type in R400
    "A" - Keep Moving to Positive direction
    "S" - Stop immediately
    "D" - Keep Moving to Negative direction
    "T" - Move to Positive direction, then move to negative direction at HALF SPEED 
    enter two numbers behind for Positive steps and negative steps, eg "T500 250"
    (As a test to draw shapes)


Speed: 4sec at 
stepper.setSpeed(600);	

X stepper go down by 3, increase the solenoid hole diameter

Other topics to consider: 
	- Check if we need calibration with Y axis:
https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/control-structures/WhileStatementConditional
	- Revisit the Test TWO example codes to understand acceleration - we'll need it to draw a circle:

	- BACK UP PLAN / Processing Codes: 
		- Use camera to capture color of 100 pixels, sent to wek as 100 inputs, each input has 3 values
		- Receive 2 outputs from wek, each output has 5 classes:
			- Output (0) refers to the Moving Direction:
			- Output (1) refers to drawing s
